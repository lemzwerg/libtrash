Manueal Arriaga 

Thanks to the following for their contributions.

- Avery Pennarun, whose "freestyle-concept" tarball showed me how to
intercept function calls and write a suitable Makefile.

- Phil Howard and wwp for pointing out problems with the (abandoned) hardrm
script. wwp also offered general advice.

- Karl Pitrich for letting me know about a bug in the calls to mkdir() and
chmod() in the code of dir_ok() which rendered the trash can (and all
subdirs) unbrowsable if you didn't manually correct their permissions with
'chmod'.

- Daniel Sadilek for letting me know that some people _did_ need
inter-device support :), the helpful cleanTrash Perl script and help testing
libtrash-0.6.

- Ross Skaliotis for helping me pin down the cause of the incompatibility
between libtrash and Samba.

- Christoph Dworzak for reporting poor handling of special files, and
providing a patch.

- Martin Corley for the alternative cleanTrash script.

- Frederic Connes for reporting a bug affecting the creation of replacement
files when open()/open64() are being intercepted and suggesting the use of
different names for 5 configuration variables. Frederic also provided two
patches against the Makefile and cleanTrash script.

- Dan Stutzbach for reporting a bug in the function readline(), sending a
patch and helping me fix it.

- Ryan Brown for reporting a memory leak.

- BBBart for reporting a bug in the handling of files with names starting
with multiple dots.

- Jacek Sliwerski (rzyjontko) for adding the IGNORE_RE feature to libtrash and
making the search for new filenames [in reformulate_new_path()] much faster.

- Robert Storey for reporting an error in the documentation.

- Raik Lieske for reporting a bug in the handling of certain file paths.

- David Benbennick for reporting mishandling of function calls with a NULL
pathname.

- Jorgen Schaefer for helping me figure out why glibc was crashing when
libtrash was active and getwc() was called.

- Philipp Woelfel for alerting me to lacking coverage of the *at() functions
and allowing me access to his system to find out what was going on. Also,
Philipp spotted the "unresolved symbol" bug in 2.7.

- Nicola Fontana for pointing out the problem with servers running as
'nobody'.

- Peter Hyman for pointing out that the default value of
REMOVABLE_MEDIA_MOUNT_POINTS was outdated.

- Kamil Dudka for sending me a patch renaming the _init/_fini
functions to avoid symbol clashes when using Audacious plugins.

- Peter Hyman (again :) ) for letting me know that Google Chrome (and
not just some versions of Firefox) also need to be launched with
'LD_PRELOAD='.

- Felix Becker for informing me about Kate, Lyx and tar creating files
with oddly restrictive permissions when libtrash was being used.

- Peter Hyman for submitting a patch adding PRESERVE_FILES_LARGER_THAN
functionality.

- Peter Hyman for single-handedly bringing libtrash to the 21st (20th?
:-) ) century by replacing the whole clunky build system with autotools
magic.

- Florian Weimer for patch that allows libtrash to compile with gcc v14.
